            <p><a href="https://capibara3.github.io/">The CAPIBARA Project</a> is a student-led initiative aiming to launch a satellite dedicated to observing and researching the high-energy cosmos. Our mission focuses on measuring primary cosmic rays (charged particles) as well as X-ray and ùõæ-ray emissions, providing valuable insights into the Universe's most energetic phenomena.</p>
            <p>By studying high-energy radiation, we aim to deepen our understanding of astrophysical processes, quantum physics, and the interactions between cosmic phenomena and Earth's space environment. Our collected data will be made publicly accessible in its totality, fostering further research and collaboration in these fields and inspiring the next generation of young scientists and engineers.</p>
            <p>We are a diverse team of high-school students passionate about both science and engineering, working together to bring this vision to life. We are immensely grateful to the <a href="https://spark-program.pldspace.com/en/">SPARK program</a> by <a href="https://pldspace.com/en/">PLD Space</a> for the opportunity to launch our mission aboard their <a href="https://pldspace.com/en/miura-5">Miura 5</a> rocket. We also extend our thanks to our teachers, mentors, families, and everybody supporting us in this adventure.</p>  
            <p>My role in this collaboration involves leading the CAPIBARA project, coordinating the efforts and [...]. Furthermore, I work to advancing research on using the ùõæ-ray and X-ray observatories to employ Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) as cosmological distance indicators, with the aim of refining the Hubble constant and testing the \(\Lambda\)CDM model.</p>

            <p><a href="genetics10.html">Genetics10</a> is a free, web-based, educational software for teaching biology and genetics. It's a Python Notebook, where students can easily play and make their code using the pre-established functions. Furthermore, advanced students can write more complex code and create other functions. The possibilities are endless! Additionally, it is web-based and does not require any installation at all, making it very easy to use and perfect for school-managed devices.</p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/joanalnu/gen_api">GEN-API</a> is an open-source API for genetic data analysis. It features the same functions as the original gen10 class in all the available languages, but it can be installed in your computer using pip and used system-wide. This enables a smoother integration for external projects, more complex data analysis and integration with other tools. It is also very easy to use and can be installed in a few seconds.</p>

            <p>Since my participation in the <a href="https://www.fundaciocatalunya-lapedrera.com/en/youth-and-science">Youth and Science program</a> by Fundaci√≥ Catalunya La Pedrera, I became deeply interested in cosmology‚Äîthe study of the Universe as a whole, including its origin, evolution, and fate. This field raises profound philosophical questions and connects to other areas, such as galactic evolution, the high-energy universe, dark matter, and dark energy.</p>
            <p>One of the most pressing questions in cosmology is the Hubble Tension. Since the first calculation of the Hubble-Lema√Ætre constant (the expansion rate of the Universe), multiple methods have been developed to refine its value. However, as instrumentation and methods have improved, the results for the Hubble constant have diverged further. This constant has profound implications for the age, fate, and composition of the Universe, yet, a hundred years after its discovery, we still do not know its exact value.</p>
            <p>In 2023, I conducted a <a href="https://github.com/joanalnu/article_hubble_jic">project</a> on recomputing the Hubble-Lema√Ætre constant using the same methods as Hubble and Lema√Ætre, but with modern data from the NASA IPAC NED database for redshift and the Konkonly Observatory for Cepheid magnitudes. With about 50 galaxies and nearly 4000 Cepheid stars, I recovered a value of \(72.104\pm0.065\) \(km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}.\)</p>
            <p>In the summer of 2024, I completed a two-month <a href="https://www.ieec.cat/en/the-ieec-hosts-two-high-school-students-through-the-youth-and-science-programme/">research stay</a> with the <a href="https://www.ice.csic.es/research/theory-observations?view=article&id=208&catid=2">Supernovae and Stellar Transients group</a> at the <a href="https://ice.csic.es/">Institute of Space Sciences (ICE-CSIC-IEEC)</a>, conducting a project on Type Ia supernovae (SNe) as cosmological distance indicators under the guidance of <a href="https://lgalbany.github.io">Dr. Llu√≠s Galbany</a>. This experience deepened my understanding of the science, enabled me to contribute to the Hostflows project, and helped me develop research skills while connecting with researchers from various fields at the institute.</p>
            <p>I‚Äôve scheduled an international research stay for summer 2025 as part of the Youth and Science program and am currently searching for institutes, laboratories, and research groups to collaborate with for this stay.</p>
            <p>All this research has been possible thanks to the Youth and Science program and the support of my tutors, mentors, and family.</p>
