          About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            Scientific research has always been at the heart of my work, with coding and computer science as key tools to drive my projects. Participating in the Youth and Science program by Fundaci√≥ Catalunya La Pedrera has been one of the most transformative experiences in my journey. It opened doors to the world of research and allowed me to gain first-hand experience in a professional scientific environment.
            <br><br>
            I have got in touch with a variety of fields, ranging from mathematics to biology, and I embrace learning about different topics. However, my true passion is cosmology and high-energy astrophysics. I‚Äôve worked on measuring the Hubble-Lemaitre Constante -the expansion rate of the Universe- first using Cepheid stars, and later on with Type Ia Supernovae collaborating at the SN-ICE group at the Institute of Space Science (ICE-CSIC-IEEC) under the guidance of Dr. Llu√≠s Galbany.
            <br><br>
            Currently, I‚Äôm focusing on how Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) could be used as cosmological distance indicators. GRBs are the most energetic events in the Universe after the Big Bang and can release as much energy as the Sun in its entire lifetime in just seconds. This make them detectable at very high redshifts, making them a powerful tool for probing the distant cosmos.
            <br><br>
            Outside the office, I love to share my science enthusiasm with others. Volunteering in scientific dissemination outreach activities, like the Explainers program by CosmoCaixa (Barcelona‚Äôs Science Museum) or the Festa de la Ci√®ncia (a science fair organised annually). I am also deeply involved in promoting STEM-related activities at my school, as well as mentoring fellow students to engage with scientific topics.

              <p><a href="https://capibara3.github.io/">The CAPIBARA Collaboration</a> is a student-led initiative aiming to launch a satellite dedicated to observing and researching the high-energy cosmos. Our mission focuses on measuring primary cosmic rays (charged particles) as well as X-ray and Œ≥-ray emissions, providing valuable insights into the Universe's most energetic phenomena.</p>
              <p>By studying high-energy radiation, we aim to deepen our understanding of astrophysical processes, quantum physics, and the interactions between cosmic phenomena and Earth's space environment. Our collected data will be made publicly accessible in its totality, fostering further research and collaboration in these fields and inspiring the next generation of young scientists and engineers.</p>
              <p>We are a diverse team of high-school students passionate about both science and engineering, working together to bring this vision to life. Therefore, we are grateful for our teachers, mentors, families, and everybody supporting us in this adventure.</p>
              <p>My role in this collaboration involves leading the CAPIBARA project, coordinating the efforts. Furthermore, I work to advance research on using the Œ≥-ray and X-ray observatories to employ Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) as cosmological distance indicators, with the aim of refining the Hubble constant and testing the ŒõCDM model.</p>

            <h2>Cosmological Research - Addressing the Hubble Tension</h2>
            <span class="close" onclick="closeModal('cosmo-modal')">&times;</span>

            <p>Since my participation in the <a href="https://www.fundaciocatalunya-lapedrera.com/en/youth-and-science">Youth and Science program</a> by Fundaci√≥ Catalunya La Pedrera, I became deeply interested in cosmology‚Äîthe study of the Universe as a whole, including its origin, evolution, and fate. This field raises profound philosophical questions: where do we come from? where are we going to? Is the Universe (in)finite?Is time infinite? Additionally, it connects to other areas, such as galactic evolution, the high-energy universe, dark matter, and dark energy.</p>
            <p>One of the most pressing questions in cosmology is the Hubble Tension. Since the first calculation of the Hubble-Lema√Ætre constant (the expansion rate of the Universe), multiple methods have been developed to refine its value. However, as instrumentation and methods have improved, the results for the Hubble constant have diverged further. This constant has profound implications for the age, fate, and composition of the Universe, yet, a hundred years after its discovery, we still do not know its exact value.</p>
            <p>In 2023, I conducted a <a href="https://github.com/joanalnu/article_hubble_jic">project</a> on recomputing the Hubble-Lema√Ætre constant using the same methods as Hubble and Lema√Ætre, but with modern data from the NASA IPAC NED database for redshift and the Konkonly Observatory for Cepheid magnitudes. With about 50 galaxies and nearly 4000 Cepheid stars, I recovered a value of $$72.104\pm0.065\ km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$$.</p>
            <p>In the summer of 2024, I completed a two-month <a href="https://www.ieec.cat/en/the-ieec-hosts-two-high-school-students-through-the-youth-and-science-programme/">research stay</a> with the <a href="https://www.ice.csic.es/research/theory-observations?view=article&id=208&catid=2">Supernovae and Stellar Transients group</a> at the <a href="https://ice.csic.es/">Institute of Space Sciences (ICE-CSIC-IEEC)</a>, conducting a project on Type Ia supernovae (SNe) as cosmological distance indicators under the guidance of <a href="https://lgalbany.github.io">Dr. Llu√≠s Galbany</a>. This experience deepened my understanding of the science, enabled me to contribute to the Hostflows project, and helped me develop research skills while connecting with researchers from various fields at the institute. At this point I improved my understanding of the current status in cosmology and enhanced my coding skills exponentially.</p>
            <p>For the last fellowship year, in summer 2025 I will be researching the potential use of Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs), extremely powerful explosions, as standard candles up to very high redshifts (z~8) with Dr. Giancarlo Ghirlanda and Dr. Om Sharan Salafia at the Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera-Merate (INAF-Brera-Merate).</p>
            <p>I would also like to kindly appreciate the support and enabling of all my tutors, mentors, family, and friends.</p>
