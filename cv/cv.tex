% ----------------- PERSONAL STATEMENT -----------------
\section*{Personal Statement}

I am Joan Alcaide Núñez (he/him), a BSc Physics student at LMU Munich with a strong interest in observational and multi-messenger cosmology. My research focus lies in combining electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations to constrain cosmological parameters and probe the nature of dark energy, with particular interest in the late-time evolution and fate of the Universe.

Between 2023 and 2025, I pursued a series of summer research projects centered on the cosmic distance ladder, recomputing the Hubble constant using Cepheids and then Type Ia Supernovae. Building on this foundation, I recently began to work with multi-messenger approaches, exploring how gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and gravitational wave observations can jointly constrain cosmological models independently of, and complementary to, standard probes. These projects introduced me early to research-level data analysis and strengthened my mathematical, programming and statistical skills early beyond the high school curriculum.

After the Youth \& Science fellowship, I have continued to develop my research interests in dark energy and multi-messenger cosmology, extending my previous work and deepening my training. In particular, I have focused on applying Bayesian inference with Monte Carlo (extending from $\chi^2$ minimization), while learning about the theoretical foundations of dark energy models and alternatives to $\Lambda$CDM. I am now seeking opportunities to further develop these skills collaboratively within an active research environment.
